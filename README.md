# SWRM-Network Auto Leasing Tool

This beta desktop application automates leasing and un-leasing functions within the SWRM or WAVES network, providing a user-friendly interface to replace traditional scripts.

## Key Features

- **Generate Seed**: Create a seed phrase locally on your device.  
  ⚠️ **Important**: Losing your seed phrase may result in loss of funds. The tool does not store or save your seed phrase externally, so it's your responsibility to copy and secure it before funding your address.

- **Lease**: Initiate a leasing transaction towards a node.

- **Cancel Lease**: Cancel an active leasing transaction.

- **Auto Lease**: Set a time interval (in seconds) for automatic leasing. The tool checks your balance before proceeding with the transaction.

- **Unlease All**: Cancel all active leasing transactions for your address in one action.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the swrm_auto_leasing_wallet.exe
2. Extract the files and run the application.

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Generate a seed phrase or paste your existing seed phrase.
3. Use the available functions to manage your leasing activities.
